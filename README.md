# Obesity-Prediction-in-R


The dataset under consideration offers an insightful exploration into the estimation of obesity levels based on a comprehensive set of variables that encompass living habits, genetics, and physical condition. Drawn from a study population across Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, it comprises 2,111 instances, each detailed across 17 variablesâ€”split between 9 categorical (character) and 8 numerical traits. The initial step in the analysis involved standardizing these variables: renaming for clarity, converting character vectors to categorical factors, and simplifying the obesity classification into a binary scheme.

During the exploratory data analysis phase, I generated histogram plots for all variables to understand their distribution. To further examine the association between these variables and obesity levels, I employed jitter plots, which revealed weight as the variable with the most pronounced distribution differences relative to obesity. Interestingly, the ratio of non-obese to obese individuals was relatively balanced, contrasting sharply with variables such as family history of obesity, high calorie food consumption, and calorie monitoring, which displayed significant disparities.

Building on these insights, additional jitter plots focusing on weight in the context of obesity allowed for the examination of patterns in the distribution of the remaining variables. Given the dataset's mixed nature (comprising both categorical and numerical variables), I applied variable clustering to identify groups of closely related variables. Subsequently, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) tailored for mixed data was conducted to assess the contribution of these variables to the principal components. The analyses collectively underscored the positive correlation of weight, family history of obesity, and high calorie intake with obesity.

To pinpoint variables capable of accurately predicting obesity, logistic regression was utilized, taking into account the mixed nature of the dataset. After reducing the data, the refined model could predict obesity based on three significant predictors: weight, family history of obesity, and weekly physical activity levels. Weight and family history were positively correlated with obesity, whereas physical activity exhibited a negative correlation.

To validate the significance of these predictors in distinguishing between obese and non-obese individuals, I conducted a series of tests: non-parametric Wilcoxon tests for the weight vs. obesity and activity per week vs. obesity datasets, and Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for the family history of obesity vs. obesity datasets. The outcomes of these tests affirmed the existence of significant differences, reinforcing the importance of these three variables in the context of obesity prediction. This analytical journey not only highlights the intricate relationship between lifestyle, genetic predisposition, and physical condition in determining obesity levels but also underscores the potential of targeted interventions in mitigating obesity risk.
